## Backend
  - task: "Health check endpoints"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Both /api/status and /api/health endpoints are working correctly. Status returns 200 with expected JSON response. Health endpoint confirms database connection is working."

  - task: "Database connection"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "PostgreSQL connection to Neon is working properly. The health endpoint confirms database connectivity. Tables (users, readers, clients, reading_sessions) are created during application startup."

  - task: "Authentication endpoints"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Authentication flow is working as expected. Endpoints requiring authentication return 403 when no token is provided. Invalid tokens are properly rejected with 401 status code. Clerk JWT verification is implemented correctly."

  - task: "Reader availability endpoints"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "medium"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "The /api/readers/available endpoint returns a properly formatted JSON array. Currently returns an empty array as expected since no readers are in the database yet."

  - task: "API structure"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "medium"

    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "All endpoints are properly prefixed with /api as required for Kubernetes routing. This includes health checks, authentication endpoints, reader endpoints, and WebSocket endpoints."

  - task: "WebSocket support"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0

      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "WebSocket endpoint at /api/ws/{user_id} is working correctly. Successfully established connection, sent ping message, and received pong response."

## Frontend
